Problem statement

Coaches, trainers, and athletes may struggle to write the most efficient workout
for each swimmer. Swimmers of different skill levels will need more or less rest
in between each set. Not only is skill level a factor, but also each swimmer's
muscle type. A 'fast-twitch' swimmer will need a more sprint-oriented workout
with shorter distance, shorter time intervals and longer rests, while a distance
swimmer will need more mileage at a slower time interval.

Additionally, everyday factors can affect your workout. If you are not feeling
well, you'll need a slower timed interval. If you are out of shape and building
up your endurance again, you may need to adjust times.

A very consistent measure of how each individual is responding to the workout is by
measuring their heart-rate. Heart-rate can show whether a workout is tailored to
each individual. Each part of a workout can have a goal of being within a certain
heart rate range to achieve results. My application will help coaches and trianers
adjust every workout depending on the heartrate of each athlete.
